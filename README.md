# shelf-lifer
Monorepo test building a web application upon AWS Lambda backend and React.js frontend. Beware: there will be many mistakes along the way...

Shelf Lifer is an app to scan food going into the fridge and cupboards, record expiry/sell-by/best before dates and notify users based on a rule-set they configure. The purpose of the app is to stop food going to waste. The feature set could be expanded later if it proves a useful product or learning exercise (or both of course).
